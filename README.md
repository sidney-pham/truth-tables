# truth-tables âž—âž•
A truth table generator that tries not to be dumb.

## Features
- A truly enlightening crash course in like 100 words of all of propositional logic
- Operator alias support
- Doesn't hurt your eyes? ðŸ‘€

#### Note
Because of some strange issue with Parcel (what a let down), you'll have to run it using `npm debug`, but then before publishing it, run `npm start` which might not work on your local machine but will work (at least on GitHub pages), and then publish *that* version.
